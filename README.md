# hands on APPLICATION FOR SKYVERGE support position

This was an attempt to get a support job at skyverge. The requirements were to create a web page and answer some questions.

At the time I didn't have the skills necessary to create a working page in time to apply, so I watched some videos and decided to modify a template I found online. I think in this project I changed some content in the HTML and a little CSS.

I did not get the position, but it inspired me to follow the path I am on today. I was frustrated with my abilities and pursued more knowledge and skills at Udacity. After a year of taking free courses, an opportunity for a Grow with Google scholarship came to me in my inbox. I was accepted and completed the nano degree program for front end web development.

This job application was such a good experience that it inspired me to get to where I am today.
