							<h1>Matt Kross</h1>
							<h2><!--[-->An Application for SkyVerge Customer Support Specialist  </h2>
							<h3>Where are you located?</h3>
							<p> Originally from St. Augustine, Fl  / Currently in Pittsfield, MA</p>							
							<h3>Why are you looking for a new position?</h3>
							<p>My search for employment contains three goals:</p> 
							<p>* A position that is remote, so I can take the job with me.</p>
							<p>* A position that is different and unique, so I can be challenged in new situations.</p>
							<p>* A position that allows me to learn new technologies so I can grow as a professional.</p>
							<h3>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</h3>
							<p>While I was employed at Merrill Lynch for two years, that was the main way we fixed employees machines. We would log on to the machine remotely to diagnose and fix or escalate the problem. This is something I also did with my own business, sometimes with the LogMeIin software. Some other experience in a remote environment would be in college. My second year at Keiser College was all distance learning. We would receive a syllabus and weekly instruction, but the student was trusted with deadlines and self study. There were forums and chat rooms for questions between students or I could contact the instructor by email. I loved it!</p>
							<h3>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?</h3>
							<p>If you are aiming for me to have a broad knowledge (mile-wide, inch-deep) while supporting multiple products, then you should look at my time at Merrill Lynch. While there I was a test subject so to speak, a call agent with an open queue. That means I was trained with everything we supported. Was I an expert in every product? No, but I did know more than the caller and was able to isolate the issue and either fix or escalate. I enjoyed the challenge and versatility it provided.</p>
							<p>You would also want to look at my time at Columbia analytical services. It was a laboratory environment with all types of lab equipment I have never seen or heard of. This equipment would be connected to computers running on all different operating systems, including windows 3.0. I was also introduced to light server management. Adding user profiles, performing server back ups and even installing a new blade server and migrating data.</p>
							<p>You might also look at my time running my own technology support business. My friend ended his 6 year computer support business and I basically inherited his customer base of residential and business clients. Any and all problems were accepted and solved. It was very exciting and challenging to move from virus removal to laptop repair to networking to email servers. The exciting and sometimes stressful part was that there was no second tier or engineers to seek help from. You had to find and understand the solution.</p>
							<p>What I have learned from this experience is it is not always the answers you know, but how to research, find, understand and apply the answer that is the key.</p>

							<h3>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?</h3>
							<p>My other work history was in the restaurant industry in St. Augustine, Fl. There were approximately 7.2 million visitors to the county in 2015. Every kitchen I worked in was high volume and always busy. You had to learn fast and make quick and accurate decisions. I found the experience to be very relevant to a help desk environment. Tickets come in and you solve problems. Every dish has a recipe, in the same way every tech problem has a procedure. I also learned there are different ways to reach the same result. You had to be accurate on every order. You can't send out raw chicken, just like you can not have a customer without email or a web site down. It was a tough job but we all took pride in doing something that others could not do. I get the same thrill from the tech world. Solving hard problems in a creative way.</p>
							<h3>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?</h3>
							<p>My knowledge at this moment would be limited and basic. I had some basic HTML classes in my e-commerce degree. I have done some small amounts of self study with CSS and JavaScript. One thing I could guarantee, if I was chosen for this position I would immerse myself in  HTML/CSS/JavaScript and get up to speed quickly. I would be willing to get certified in all relevant technologies.</p>
							<h3>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?</h3>
							<p>As I stated previously, I enjoy solving problems and helping people who need assistance. It is a pleasure to share knowledge with those who need it. I am also an avid notetaker. It is very important to document every call to not only have a history of the caller, but to leave a roadmap for future employees. It is a great feeling to be part of a great team moving towards success.</p>
							<h3>Anything else we should know about you?</h3>
							<p>I have a 5 year old son named Kobe. He loves dinosaurs and ninjas!</p>

										<h4> Imagine a potential customer emails you with the following question. We don’t yet offer this feature, but their current solution does. How would you respond?</h4>
										<h4>"I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews? "</h4>
										<p>While I understand you have to make the choice that is right for you and your business, unfortunately SkyVerge does not offer product customization with live image preview at this time. It is a feature that is in the development phase at this moment. I could check with the engineers for an estimated time of arrival and notify you of launch. </p>
										<p>We do also offer customized solutions, maybe we could find a solution that fits your specifications. What type of product are you customizing? Is this a product that would go straight to production-ready output? Send me a little more details of your situation and I can see if we can create a solution package for you.</p>

										<h3>Fire Alarm</h3>
										<h4>Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take? </h4>
										<p>These type of outages would happen a lot at Merrill Lynch, mostly on Monday mornings after weekend updates, lol. We would go into triage mode on the phones, notifying of problem, gathering contact info and giving an estimated time of fix (sometimes).</p>
										<p>The first thing I would do is reach out to management/engineering and either inform them of the problem or gather info of the issue. If for some reason no one in management or engineering was available at the time, I would gather troubleshooting info from the customers. While most would likely be aggressive, there usually is someone with a helpful demeanor. Assuming this could be caused by some service down or platform update, I would also research those angles and if helpful, share findings with team. Once the problem was identified and confirmed with team, I would begin notifying customers of a solution or an estimated time of fix.</p>

										<h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
										<h4>We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase. </h4>
										<p>The last thing I purchased online was a birthday present for my son Kobe. It was actually an easy purchase, that did not need much research. Time for a small back story. I moved to Massachusetts to help care for my father. It was a hard choice to leave my son in Florida, but my dad was completely alone with multiple ailments. Kobe and I have daily phone conversations. Nightly story time and sometimes imagination/play time. In those playtime calls he usually wants to play Jurassic Park with ninjas or army men fighting flying sharks and dinosaurs. He says “you can turn into anything you want”, lol.</p>
										<p>So when his birthday came on May 1, I had a good idea of what to get, dinosaur toys and army men so he could have some epic battles. I wanted the search to be somewhat quick. I searched for “dinosaur toys”on google shopping to get a visual idea of what's out there. I changed search to “dinosaur toys playset”. In the results I zeroed in on the “Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs”. I then grabbed that search term and went back to google main, not liking the $36 prices I was seeing. First result was Toys R Us, but I skipped over because I am not a fan of their search results. So many toys, easy to get lost in there. Next was Amazon, so I ran a search, found it and added to cart. Next I entered “army man playset” in the search bar. The sixth result was the “True Heroes Ultimate Military Playset- 100 piece set with storage container”. I was excited that both playsets came with a storage container! It was also added to cart. Having purchased from Amazon before the credit Card number was saved in my account info. Having shipped to Kobe’s grandma before, the shipping was already there. At this point, feeling satisfied and jealous of Kobe’s birthday present, I placed the order.</p>
										<p>In hindsight I probably should have went with Toys R Us. I went back to price it the next day, and I would have saved $10. Also one of the packages came a day early. The other came two days late. It was fine because he went to LegoLand on his birthday and had a leftover present the next day. Funny thing is the package that was late had Toys R us markings on it, lol. He had a great birthday and loves his toys! Hope that helps?</p>
